<h1>Pollution Reporting Tool</h1>
<p>Pollution Reporting Tool is the online platform for reporting environment-unfriendly behaviour
  and pollution of any type. Community is the heart of the platform. Users will report, associations will take actions.
</p>
<p> This page serves as an online guide for our platform, including all steps from registration to reporting an event. Let's begin:</p>


<h1>Logging in</h1>
<p> When you first open the website, a welcome page will appear, presenting basic functionalities of our platform.</p>
<img src = "./intro.png"/>
<p>Here you can click the "Get started" button which appears both at the beggining and the end of the page. Afterwards, you will see the main interface.</p>
<img src = "./interface.png"/>
<p> Besides others, you will see the button to add a report. You can walk through the steps, however you first have to login in order to successfully do that.
  Lets do that.</p>
  <p>To the left, you will see an user icon which will display the log in menu</p>
  <img src = "./login-route.png"/>
  <img src = "./login-panel.png"/>
  <p> Now you can enter your credentials or click the "New? Sign up!" Button to register.</p>
  <img src ="./register.png"/>
  <p>Once you complete the form, you will be redirected to the main page and you can follow the above steps to log in.</p>

  <h1>User options</h1>
  <img src = "./login-logged.png"/>
  <p> Here you can see the options an user has once logged in the website. You can generate CSV/PDF reports of all the reports in our system,
    or even see them in the platform in a html page.</p>
    <img src = "./report-view.png"/>
  <p>You have the options to see both your and global status of reports, but before that, let's add a new report.
  On the main page, at the bottom, you will see a button for adding reports</p>
  <h1>Adding reports</h1>
  <img src = "./report-button.png"/>
  <p>Once clicked, you will be prompted to insert a title and a description for the report. Afterwards we can click the next arrow</p>
  <img src = "./report-pictures.png"/>
  <p>In this form we can insert images related to our current report. Users will then be able to see these images attached to your report</p>
  <img src = "./report-added.png"/>
  <p>If all went well, you will see your report on the map</p>
  <img src = "./report-failure.png"/>
  <p>Otherwise, this error message will pop up, telling you what's preventing the report from being added.</p>
